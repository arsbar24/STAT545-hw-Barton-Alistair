## Homework 3 Process Report

* Had trouble using `sum()` with the `yearslived` and `pop` variables due to overflow. Followed R's instructions to use `sum(as.numeric())`.

* Didn't know how to find the n-th element of a vector. Solved this problem by guessing based on my experience with other languages.

* Didn't know how to declare a variable as the output of piping. Found a solution in one of the lectures.
