# STAT545-hw01-barton-alistair

## Table of Contents

0. Assignment 1 (in this folder) mostly involves vague data exploration and this file.

1. [Assignment 2](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/tree/master/hw02) explores datasets and uses functions from the `dplyr` packages such as `filter()`, `select()` and `%>%` to analyze `gapminder`.

2. [Assignment 3](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/tree/master/hw03) explores `ggplot` packages and many of its parameters.

3. [Assignment 4](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/tree/master/hw04) explores use of the different `_join` functions and general data reshaping for the purposes of data-manipulation and making easier comparisons between different factors (e.g. countries)

4. [Assignment 5](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/tree/master/hw05) explores factor reorganization and plot beautification.

5. [Assignment 6](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/tree/master/hw06) explores creation of functions, revisiting data wrangling with a messy candy dataset, and regular expression analysis (with respect to Trump's tweets).

6. [Assignment 7](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/tree/master/hw07) explores automation of the above analysis of Trump's tweets by use of a `Makefile`.



## Introduction to Alistair

I'm a math grad student taking this course to learn useful stuff.

Here's a list of some *less* useful stuff I like: 

* sports

(fun fact, I was actually at this game)

* philosophy (really reading, but I don't have any good photos for that)

* food

This summer I spent a month [here](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china). To prove it, here's a photo of me on a stylish camel (wearing even more stylish footwear):

**Process:** I edited in browser at the beginning, but touched things up locally. Used [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to help. Had trouble getting photos to a reasonable size using markdown, realized I could do it via html by StackOverflow, but decided against it because you can't view it in browser. Used some help from [Jenny Bryan's github](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) for manipulating the Gapminder dataset (in particular for the `group_by()` function).
