## 2. Writing functions
>Write one (or more) functions that do something useful to pieces of the Gapminder or Singer data. It is logical to think about computing on the mini-data frames corresponding to the data for each specific country, location, year, band, album, â€¦ This would pair well with the prompt below about working with a nested data frame, as you could apply your function there.


In my last assignment for 545 I created a map of the world with countries coloured corresponding to a quantitative variable. This was a fun thing to do, but I'd like to make it easier to do in the future, so I'm going to write a function that takes in some collection of gapminder data (one entry per country) and outputs a dataset that's ready to be made into a map. 

The map data is essentially a bunch of coordinates detailing where the edge of each country lies. We can then use `geom_polygon` to draw these on a graph, and use the `fill` option to colour them according to any variable we choose.

To combine gapminder data with map data it suffices to use a simple `left_join()`; however there are a couple technicalities that must be tackled first. For one, the map dataset labels its countries as "regions", so we must relabel this column as it is the joining variable. On a similar note, many of the gapminder countries are not named the same in the map datasets (e.g. "USA" vs. "United States"), so we will relabel some of them (this is the most tedious thing that I'd like to do once and for all). There are also many countries in the map data not represented in gapminder, but we will ignore this.

Let us first identify the mislabeled countries:


```r
map <- map_data("world") %>% 
    mutate(country = as.factor(region)) %>%  # factorize country for our map
    select(-region)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'maps'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
## 
##     map
```

```r
gapcountries <- summarize(group_by(gapminder,country),mean(pop))

knitr::kable(anti_join(gapcountries, map))
```

```
## Joining, by = "country"
```

```
## Warning: Column `country` joining factors with different levels, coercing
## to character vector
```



country                mean(pop)
--------------------  ----------
Congo, Dem. Rep.        32681655
Congo, Rep.              1923209
Cote d'Ivoire            9153110
Hong Kong, China         4792259
Korea, Dem. Rep.        16453881
Korea, Rep.             36499386
Slovak Republic          4774507
Trinidad and Tobago      1006470
United Kingdom          56087801
United States          228211232
West Bank and Gaza       1848606
Yemen, Rep.             10843192

Notably, there is no Russia in gapminder. We can identify the matching country in our map data by listing all its levels:


```r
knitr::kable(head(levels(map$country)))
```

```
## Warning in kable_markdown(x = structure(c("Afghanistan", "Albania",
## "Algeria", : The table should have a header (column names)
```



|               |
|:--------------|
|Afghanistan    |
|Albania        |
|Algeria        |
|American Samoa |
|Andorra        |
|Angola         |

Doing this, we find the mismatch to be countries labelled ("Congo, Dem. Rep.", "Congo, Rep.", "Cote d'Ivoire", "Korea, Dem. Rep.", "Korea, Rep.", "Slovak Republic", "Trinidad and Tobago", "United Kingdom", "United States", "West Bank and Gaza", "Yemen, Rep.") in gapminder and countries labelled ("Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Republic of Congo", "Ivory Coast", "North Korea", "South Korea", "Slovakia", "Trinidad", "UK", "USA", "Palestine", "Yemen") in the map data. Hong Kong is thus the only country in gapminder that isn't in the map data.

Now that we have this information we are ready to write our function:


```r
#' Concatenate a dataset to a map.
#' 
#' @param data data with a country column.
#' @return Map data with country data joined to it.
gapmap <- function(data, region = "world") {
    if("country" %in% colnames(data) == FALSE) {
    stop('data must be dataframe with a country column')
    }
  
  # relabel region column
  map <- map_data(region) %>% 
    mutate(country = as.factor(region)) %>%  # factorize country for our map
    mutate(country = as.factor(region)) %>%  # factorize country for our map
    select(-region)
  
  # relabel countries to match gapminder
  gapcountry <- c("Congo, Dem. Rep.", "Congo, Rep.", "Cote d'Ivoire", "Korea, Dem. Rep.", "Korea, Rep.", "Slovak Republic", "Trinidad and Tobago", "United Kingdom", "United States", "West Bank and Gaza", "Yemen, Rep.")
  mapcountry <- c("Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Republic of Congo", "Ivory Coast", "North Korea", "South Korea", "Slovakia", "Trinidad", "UK", "USA", "Palestine", "Yemen")
  for(i in 1:length(gapcountry)){
    levels(map$country)[levels(map$country)==mapcountry[i]] <- gapcountry[i]
  }
  return(left_join(map, data, by = "country"))
}
```

where we use a for loop to simplify our relabelling process (I tried vectorizing it but R took it to mean something different).

We now show an example of how to use it to colour countries by population:


```r
countrypop <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(pop = pop[length(pop)])

knitr::kable(head(countrypop))
```



country             pop
------------  ---------
Afghanistan    31889923
Albania         3600523
Algeria        33333216
Angola         12420476
Argentina      40301927
Australia      20434176

```r
map <- gapmap(countrypop)
```

```

```


```r
ggplot(data = map) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = log(pop), group = group)) +
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  scale_colour_continuous("log Maximum\n GDP per cap.")
```
