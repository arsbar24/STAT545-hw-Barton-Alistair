## Process Report for Homework 2

* I did my R work locally, typed this report up via the online interface. 

* I had some trouble finding out how to create the new folder within my repo, ended up doing it by creating a new file `hw02/Process-Repord.md` in my old repo.

* I didn't know how to find class, but got a lucky guess when I typed `?class` into the console. This also taught me a bit about what a class is.

* Likewise I found `dim()`, `NCOL()`, and `NROW()` by typing `?ncol` into the console in my search for information about it.

* I didn't know if there were any differences between `NCOL()` and `length()` so I fed them different vectors to see how they did

* I didn't know how to get a boxplot, so I googled it. I ended up figuring out from [this site](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/box-plots/#basic-boxplot), although it wasn't easy.

* The rest of the assignment I made it through alright, with a few checks on my notes from lecture c005.
