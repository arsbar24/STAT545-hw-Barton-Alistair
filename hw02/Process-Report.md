## Process Report for Homework 2

* I did my R work locally, typed this process report up via the online interface. 

* I had some trouble creating the new folder on github, ended up doing it on the interface by creating a new file `hw02/Process-Repord.md` in my old repo (now realize I could've done it locally).

* I didn't know how to find class, but got a lucky guess when I typed `?class` into the console. This also taught me what a class means (that I included in my Rmd file).

* Likewise I found `dim()`, `NCOL()`, and `NROW()` by typing `?ncol` into the console in my search for information about it.

* I didn't know if there were any differences between `NCOL()` and `length()` so I fed them different vectors to see how they did (found out the transpose function `t()` through google).

* I didn't know how to get a boxplot, so I googled it. I ended up figuring out from [this site](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/box-plots/#basic-boxplot), although it wasn't easy. I tried to add some features to make mine more interesting but couldn't get `alpha = year` to work, gave up and settled for `alpha = 0.5`.

* I found the `group_by()` function on [Jenny Bryan's github](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder).

* I figured out how to use `knitr::kable()` by a lucky guess.

* The rest of the assignment I made it through without significant difficulty, with the help of my notes from lecture c005.
