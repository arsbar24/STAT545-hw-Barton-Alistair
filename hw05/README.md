I know most people are sick of `gapminder`, but I'm a bit of a map geek (much more than a music geek at least) so I'm going to stick to what I love and continue analyzing it :)

The main project is in the [Assignment 5](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/blob/master/hw05/Assignment_5.md) file, after which I continue in the [GDPmap file](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/blob/master/hw05/GDPmap.md). This is because I wanted to read my data into a different Rmd file in order to work with it.

I was very happy to create a map chart, as that has long been a (minor) goal of mine. I was surprised at how easy it was, and am looking forward to doing more (perhaps in the second half of the course?).


## Progress Report

I found this assignment pretty challenging. The [last section](https://github.com/arsbar24/STAT545-hw-barton-alistair/blob/master/hw05/GDPmap.md) in particular forced me to draw resources from many previous assignments (e.g. `group_by`, `join()` and factor organization) as well as from many exterior links:

* I used a lot of information from [links](http://stat545.com/graph00_index.html) shared for the assignment, especially for inspiration for some plots (e.g. `viridis` package).

* I also used this [site](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html) to create my maps.

* and [the R cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Renaming_levels_of_a_factor/) to relabel my factors.

* I used [this](https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/bar.html) to create my stacked bar chart.
