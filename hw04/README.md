# Homework Summary

### Task 1


### Task 2

- [X] create data set
- [X] fully explore `_join()`s
- [ ] explore `merge()`
- [ ] explore `match()`


## Progress Report

* I was pleasantly surprised that `left_join()` worked when I had two variables to join with (year and continent).

* Found out how to label the different colour scales via StackOverflow.

* Learnt how to do checkmarks on md files via a [github blog post](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments) (I found this really cool).

* Learnt a lot from Jenny Bryan's [join cheatsheet](http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html#anti_joinsuperheroes-publishers) for integrating my `_join()` functions.
