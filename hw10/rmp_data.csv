Although he is boring and class isn't the most enjoyable part of your life, as the class comes to a close you'll realize that he definitely has made you learn and understand the material well.

The 491 class is cake - IF you do the assignments, which are numerous.  Incredible amounts of reading, quizzes each class, journals and four papers.  Yikes.

"97","University of Maine","Tom Byther","COS220","2.0","5.0","Very loud, but monotone. Lectures are all powerpoints.
