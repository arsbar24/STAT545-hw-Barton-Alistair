```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
```

We begin by reading the scraped data:

```{r}
data <- read_csv("rmp_data.csv")[-1]
```

The first thing is to look for correlation between difficulty and overall rating:

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Difficulty, y = OverallRating)) + geom_jitter(aes(colour = Grade), alpha = 0.8) + geom_smooth()
```


We also might want to see how ratings correlate with the date, perhaps harder ratings occur in December and April when most universities have exams?

```{r}

data$Date <- data$Date %>% 
  format(format = "%m-%d") %>% 
  as.Date(format = "%m-%d")

ggplot(data, aes(x = Date)) + geom_density()
```
